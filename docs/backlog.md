# Engineering Backlog

This backlog collects cross-cutting or future action items that emerge from reviews and planning.

Routing guidance:

- Use this file for non-urgent optimizations, refactors, or follow-ups that span multiple stories/epics.
- Must-fix items to ship a story belong in that story’s `Tasks / Subtasks`.
- Same-epic improvements may also be captured under the epic Tech Spec `Post-Review Follow-ups` section.

| Date | Story | Epic | Type | Severity | Owner | Status | Notes |
| ---- | ----- | ---- | ---- | -------- | ----- | ------ | ----- |
| 2025-11-10 | 1.3 | 1 | Doc | High | TBD | Open | Add the required Dev Notes `.bind(domain="annuity", execution_id="exec_123")` example + JSON payload so AC-5 is satisfied (docs/stories/1-3-structured-logging-framework.md). |
| 2025-11-10 | 1.3 | 1 | Doc | Medium | TBD | Open | Document LOG_LEVEL/LOG_TO_FILE/LOG_FILE_DIR in `.env.example` to match `work_data_hub.utils.logging` expectations. |
