# Performance Considerations

## Optimization Guidelines

- Profile before optimizing - use `cProfile` or `py-spy`
- Use `lru_cache` for expensive computations
- Prefer generators for large datasets
- Use `asyncio` for I/O-bound operations
- Consider `multiprocessing` for CPU-bound tasks
- Cache database queries appropriately

## Example Optimization

```python
from functools import lru_cache
import asyncio
from typing import AsyncIterator

@lru_cache(maxsize=1000)
def expensive_calculation(n: int) -> int:
    """Cache results of expensive calculations."""
    # Complex computation here
    return result

async def process_large_dataset() -> AsyncIterator[dict]:
    """Process large dataset without loading all into memory."""
    async with aiofiles.open('large_file.json', mode='r') as f:
        async for line in f:
            data = json.loads(line)
            # Process and yield each item
            yield process_item(data)
```
