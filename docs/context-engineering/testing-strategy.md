# Testing Strategy

## Test-Driven Development (TDD)

1. **Write the test first** - Define expected behavior before implementation
2. **Watch it fail** - Ensure the test actually tests something
3. **Write minimal code** - Just enough to make the test pass
4. **Refactor** - Improve code while keeping tests green
5. **Repeat** - One test at a time

## Testing Best Practices

```python
# Always use pytest fixtures for setup
import pytest
from datetime import datetime

@pytest.fixture
def sample_user():
    """Provide a sample user for testing."""
    return User(
        id=123,
        name="Test User",
        email="test@example.com",
        created_at=datetime.now()
    )

# Use descriptive test names
def test_user_can_update_email_when_valid(sample_user):
    """Test that users can update their email with valid input."""
    new_email = "newemail@example.com"
    sample_user.update_email(new_email)
    assert sample_user.email == new_email

# Test edge cases and error conditions
def test_user_update_email_fails_with_invalid_format(sample_user):
    """Test that invalid email formats are rejected."""
    with pytest.raises(ValidationError) as exc_info:
        sample_user.update_email("not-an-email")
    assert "Invalid email format" in str(exc_info.value)
```

## Test Organization

- Unit tests: Test individual functions/methods in isolation
- Integration tests: Test component interactions
- End-to-end tests: Test complete user workflows
- Keep test files next to the code they test
- Use `conftest.py` for shared fixtures
- Aim for 80%+ code coverage, but focus on critical paths
