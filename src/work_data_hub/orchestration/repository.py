"""
Dagster Definitions module for WorkDataHub orchestration.

This module serves as the central registry for all Dagster components
in the WorkDataHub project, enabling discovery through `dagster dev`.

The module exports a single `defs` object containing all jobs, schedules,
and sensors, following Dagster's recommended Definitions pattern for
code location registration.
