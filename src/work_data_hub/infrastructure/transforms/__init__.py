Pipeline Transformation Steps

Provides standard, reusable pipeline transformation steps that can be composed
to build domain-specific data processing pipelines.

This module will be populated in Story 5.6 when standard pipeline steps are
extracted from domain implementations and made available as infrastructure components.

Components (Story 5.6):
- mapping: MappingStep for column mapping and renaming
- calculation: CalculationStep for computed fields
- cleansing: CleansingStep for data cleansing integration
- filtering: FilterStep for row filtering
- common: Common transformation utilities
