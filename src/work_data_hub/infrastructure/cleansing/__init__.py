"""
Data Cleansing Infrastructure

Provides cross-domain data cleansing services through a registry-based system.
Cleansing rules are defined per domain and field in YAML configuration.

IMPORTANT: This is a placeholder for Story 5.2. It will eventually replace the
current top-level `work_data_hub.cleansing` module, which will remain at the
top level until Story 5.2 completes the migration.

This module will be populated in Story 5.2 when the cleansing module is migrated
from top-level to infrastructure/.

Components (Story 5.2):
- registry: Rule registration and lookup
- rules: Cleansing rule implementations
- settings: Cleansing configuration loading
